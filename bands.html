    <h2>1960s Bands</h2>
    <h3>1960's</h3>
    <p>Marvin Gaye - Marvin Gaye was an American singer, songwriter, and producer who became one of Motown's most influential and soulful voices. Born in Washington, D.C. in 1939, he began his career as a session drummer before signing to Motown Records in the early 1960s. With a smooth, emotional vocal style, Gaye delivered a series of hits such as "Ain't That Peculiar," "How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved by You)," and duets with Tammi Terrell, including the classic "Ain't No Mountain High Enough."
Following Terrell's death and growing frustration with Motown's pop formula, Gaye shifted toward more expressive, socially conscious music. In 1971 he released What's Going On, a groundbreaking album addressing war, poverty, and environmental issues, which is widely regarded as one of the greatest albums in music history. He later explored sensual and personal themes with albums like Let's Get It On (1973) and Here, My Dear (1978).
Despite professional success, Gaye faced struggles with depression and personal conflict. His life was tragically cut short in 1984 when he was shot by his father. Today, Marvin Gaye is celebrated as a visionary who helped elevate soul and R&B into powerful forms of personal and political expression. <a href="https://www.biography.com/musicians/marvin-gaye" target="_blank" aria-label="Marvin Gaye website">Learn more about Marvin Gaye</a></p>
    <p>The Beatles - The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, featuring John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. They began as a skiffle and rock 'n' roll group, building their early popularity playing clubs in Hamburg and Liverpool. By the early 1960s, they sparked an international phenomenon known as "Beatlemania," becoming global icons through infectious pop hits and charismatic performances.
Their music evolved rapidly, pushing creative boundaries in the studio. Groundbreaking albums like Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band transformed popular music with innovative songwriting, recording techniques, and experimentation. They helped redefine rock as an art form, influencing culture, fashion, and social change.
The group stopped touring in 1966 and focused on studio work until tensions led to their breakup in 1970. After their split, each member pursued solo careers. Despite their relatively short time as a band, The Beatles remain one of the most influential and successful musical acts in history, shaping modern music and popular culture worldwide. <a href="https://www.thebeatles.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="The Beatles website">Learn more about The Beatles</a></p>

    <h2>1970s Bands</h2>
    <h4>1970's</h4>
    <p>Black Sabbath - Black Sabbath are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham in 1968 by guitarist Tony Iommi, bassist Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward, and vocalist Ozzy Osbourne. Often credited as the pioneers of heavy metal, they developed a dark, heavy sound influenced by blues rock, powerful guitar riffs, and lyrics exploring horror, social issues, and the occult.
Their 1970 self-titled debut album, along with Paranoid (featuring classics like "Iron Man," "War Pigs," and "Paranoid") established the core elements of metal music. After lineup changes and internal tensions—most famously Osbourne's departure in 1979—Black Sabbath continued with new vocalists such as Ronnie James Dio, who helped produce more acclaimed work, including the album Heaven and Hell.
Despite decades of turbulence and member changes, Black Sabbath remained influential. The original lineup reunited several times, ultimately releasing their final studio album 13 in 2013. Their final performance was in Birmingham in 2017, marking the end of a band widely regarded as the founders of heavy metal. <a href="https://www.blacksabbath.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Black Sabbath website">Learn more about Black Sabbath</a></p>
    <p>Fleetwood Mac - Fleetwood Mac are a British–American rock band formed in London in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green, drummer Mick Fleetwood, and later joined by bassist John McVie. Originally known for their blues-rock style, the band gained early recognition in the UK with hits like "Albatross" and "Black Magic Woman."
The group's sound shifted in the mid-1970s when American musicians Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham joined. This new lineup created a more melodic, pop-rock style, leading to worldwide success. Their 1977 album Rumours, written amid intense personal breakups within the band, became one of the best-selling albums of all time and includes classics like "Go Your Own Way," "Dreams," and "The Chain."
Fleetwood Mac continued to release successful music despite ongoing interpersonal conflicts and lineup changes. They remained a major touring band through the decades, with multiple reunions of their most famous members. Today, they are celebrated for their emotional songwriting, vocal harmonies, and enduring influence on rock and pop music. <a href="https://www.fleetwoodmacofficial.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="Fleetwood Mac website">Learn more about Fleetwood Mac</a></p>

    <h5>1980's</h5>
    <p>Michael Jackson - Michael Jackson was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer, widely known as the "King of Pop." Born in 1958 in Gary, Indiana, he first gained fame as the youngest member of The Jackson 5, a Motown group that produced hits like "ABC" and "I Want You Back." His charismatic stage presence and vocal talent quickly made him a standout star.
Jackson launched a hugely successful solo career in the late 1970s, and his 1982 album Thriller became the best-selling album of all time, featuring iconic tracks such as "Billie Jean," "Beat It," and "Thriller." Known for his groundbreaking music videos, cutting-edge production, and electrifying performances (including the famous moonwalk), he transformed pop music into a global, multimedia art form. Other landmark albums like Off the Wall, Bad, and Dangerous cemented his influence on pop, R&B, and dance.
Though his life included intense media attention and controversy, his musical legacy remains monumental. Michael Jackson's artistry, innovation, and global impact continue to influence musicians, dancers, and pop culture worldwide. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Jackson" target="_blank" aria-label="Michael Jackson website">Learn more about Michael Jackson</a></p>
    <p>AC/DC - AC/DC are an Australian rock band formed in Sydney in 1973 by brothers Angus and Malcolm Young. Known for their raw, hard-driving sound and energetic live performances, they became pioneers of hard rock and influenced generations of heavy music. Early success came with albums like High Voltage and Let There Be Rock, and charismatic vocalist Bon Scott helped define the band's rebellious image until his sudden death in 1980.
After Scott's death, AC/DC continued with new singer Brian Johnson, releasing Back in Black later that same year. The album became one of the best-selling records in music history, featuring classic anthems like "Hells Bells," "You Shook Me All Night Long," and the title track "Back in Black." Their riff-driven sound, led by Angus Young's signature guitar work and schoolboy stage outfit, became a defining trademark.
Despite lineup changes and the death of Malcolm Young in 2017, AC/DC have remained one of rock's most enduring acts. With massive hits such as "Highway to Hell," "Thunderstruck," and "T.N.T.," they continue to be celebrated for their no-frills rock 'n' roll and worldwide influence across rock and metal music. <a href="https://www.ac-dc.net/" target="_blank" aria-label="AC/DC website">Learn more about AC/DC</a></p>
